# drawing_with_arduino
<p> Ardui-Sketch, a drawing arm operated by two knobs allowing the user to control the movement and markings of the pencil.</p>

Below is an instructional of how to create the one and only ardui-sketch.

<header>Materials:</header>
*(1) arduino*
*(1) breadboard*
*(2) potentiometers*
*(2) servos*
*(1) wooden pencil*
*(1) hot glue gun & glue// you can use any glue but hot glue is best if you want to avoid damaging your materials*
*(1) piece of wood about 32 x 32 cm // I suggest using a light weight piece of wood*
*(1) laser cutter*
*(1) Exacto Knife and/or Scissors* 

Programs Needed:
arduino 
illustrator 


Step 1: Review the code provided and try to understand it. If you have any questions regarding the commenting, reach out to me! 
Step 2: Time to bond with your arduino. Below is a photo of the 

Step 2: In Illustrator create a shape for your baseboard which the drawing arm, arduino and bread boards will be attached to. Print on laser cutter. 
Step 3: In Illustrator create a shape for your drawing arm and print on laser cutter.
Step 4: Using the hot glue gun glue your arduino and breadboards to your piece of wood. 
Step 5: Glue one servo motor to the baseboard. Once it is dry, glue the drawing arm surface onto the servo. 
Step 6: Glue the second servo motor onto the drawing arm surface. Once it is dry, glue the second drawing arm surface onto the second servo. 
Step 7. Measure the distance between the second drawing arm and your table surface. Using your exacto knife cut a pencil according to your measurements. 
Step 8. Glue pencil to the drawing arm. 

Here is a quick video showing how to assemble the serves to the drawing arms. 




### Acknowledgment 
I would like thank my Professor Sarah Garcin for her help with the ardui-sketch!
